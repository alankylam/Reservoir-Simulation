# Context

The objective of reservoir engineering is optimization of producing oil & gas reservoirs. To obtain optimum profit from a field the engineer or the engineering team must identify and define all individual reservoirs and their physical properties, deduce each reservoir's performance, prevent drilling of unnecessary wells, initiate operating controls at the proper time, and consider all important economic factors.
